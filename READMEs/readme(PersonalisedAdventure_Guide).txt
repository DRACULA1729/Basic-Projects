This project is a simple interactive console-based travel planner written in Python. The program engages the user by asking for their name and then prompts them to choose a travel destination between "Mountain" and "Beach."

Here's a breakdown of the main components of the project:

User Input: The program starts by greeting the user and asking for their name, which is formatted to title case. It then asks the user to select a destination.

Destination Selection: The desti() function handles the user's choice of destination. It checks if the input matches "Mountain" or "Beach" and proceeds accordingly. If the input is invalid, it prompts the user to try again.

Budget Input: After selecting a destination, the program calls the budget() function, where the user is prompted to enter their budget. The program evaluates the budget and provides feedback based on its value (high, good, or budget-friendly).

Budget Evaluation: The budgetEva() function calculates the total cost of the trip based on the user's budget and the number of days they plan to stay. It prompts the user for the number of days and computes the total cost by multiplying the budget by the number of days.

Error Handling: The program includes error handling to ensure that the user inputs valid integers for their budget and the number of days.

Overall, the project demonstrates basic concepts of user input, conditionals, functions, and error handling in Python, making it a good exercise for beginners in programming.
