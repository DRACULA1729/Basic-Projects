This project is a simple console-based quiz game implemented in Python. The game welcomes players, asks for their names, and then presents them with a series of multiple-choice questions. Here's a breakdown of its features:

Welcome Message: The game starts with a friendly greeting and prompts the player for their name, which is then used in subsequent interactions.

Question and Answer Format: The quiz consists of 10 questions covering various topics, including astronomy, programming, literature, and mathematics. Each question is presented with four answer choices labeled A, B, C, and D.

User Input: Players enter their answers in lowercase, and the game checks if the provided answer is correct. If the answer is correct, the player's score is incremented; if wrong, a message is displayed indicating the error.

Scoring System: The game keeps track of the player's score throughout the quiz, providing feedback after each question.

End of Game Summary: At the end of the quiz, the player receives a final score, and the game concludes with a farewell message.

Overall, this project serves as an interactive way for users to test their knowledge across various subjects while enjoying a simple and engaging user experience.
