This project is a simple command-line based shopping cart application implemented in Python. It allows users to interactively add items to their cart, specify quantities, and calculate the total cost of their order. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its key features:

User Greeting: The program starts by prompting the user for their name and greets them, setting a friendly tone for the interaction.

Item Selection: Users are prompted to add items to their cart. The available items are Bread, Butter, and Milk, each with a predefined price:

Bread: 20 bucks
Butter: 15 bucks
Milk: 30 bucks
Input Validation: The program includes input validation to ensure that users enter valid quantities and item choices. If the user inputs a negative quantity or an invalid item, the program will prompt them to try again.

Quantity Input: Users can specify the quantity of each item they wish to purchase. The program ensures that the quantity is a positive integer.

Total Cost Calculation: After the user has finished adding items, the program calculates the total cost based on the quantities and prices of the selected items.

Order Summary: Finally, the program outputs a summary of the order, listing each item, the quantity ordered, and the total cost.

User Experience: The application is designed to be interactive and user-friendly, guiding users through the process of placing an order while handling errors gracefully.

Overall, this project serves as a basic example of how to build a console-based application for managing a shopping cart, emphasizing user interaction, input validation, and simple arithmetic operations.
