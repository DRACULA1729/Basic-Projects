This project is a student grading system implemented in Python. It allows users (students) to input their names and marks for various subjects, calculates their percentage, and assigns a grade based on their performance.

Key Features:
Greeting Function:

The program starts by greeting the user with a friendly message.
Getting Student Name:

The user is prompted to input their name, which is then formatted to title case for consistency.
Inputting Marks:

The program collects marks for a predefined set of subjects: Maths, Science, English, Social Science, and Hindi.
It also provides an option for the user to input additional subjects and their respective marks if they have more subjects to include.
Calculating Percentage:

The total marks are calculated by summing the individual subject marks.
The percentage is computed based on the total marks obtained relative to the maximum possible marks (100 per subject).
Grade Assignment:

Based on the calculated percentage, the program assigns a letter grade:
A for 90% and above
B for 80% to 89%
C for 60% to 79%
D for 40% to 59%
F for below 40%
Output:

Finally, the program outputs the student's name, their percentage, and the corresponding grade in a formatted message.
User Interaction:
The program is interactive, using the console to gather input from the user.
It ensures that all inputs are handled appropriately, including converting the name to title case and validating the marks input.
Potential Enhancements:
Error handling could be added to manage invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric marks).
The program could be expanded to include features such as saving the results to a file or allowing multiple students to be processed in one run.
A graphical user interface (GUI) could be developed to make the application more user-friendly.
Overall, this project serves as an educational tool for students to understand their academic performance while practicing programming concepts such as functions, loops, and conditionals in Python.
