This project is a simple task management application implemented in Python. It allows users to perform the following operations:

Add Tasks: Users can input a task's title, description, deadline, and priority level, which are then stored in a list of tasks.

Edit Tasks: Users can edit existing tasks by providing the task's title and the new values for any of the fields (title, description, deadline, priority). If a field is left blank, it remains unchanged.

Print Tasks: Users can view all the tasks currently stored in the application, displaying their titles, descriptions, deadlines, and priority levels.

Arrange Tasks by Priority: Users can sort and display tasks based on their priority levels, allowing them to see which tasks are most urgent.

Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list by specifying the title of the task they wish to delete.

The application interacts with the user through a console interface, prompting them for input at various stages. It also includes basic error handling, such as notifying users if a task they wish to edit or delete does not exist. Overall, it serves as a basic tool for managing and organizing tasks effectively.
